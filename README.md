# SMS/Email Spam Classifier ðŸ“§

This project is an SMS and Email Spam Classifier built using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning. The classifier helps identify whether a given message is spam or not.

## Features

- **Real-time Classification**: Instantly classify messages as "Spam" or "Not Spam" using a trained machine learning model.
- **User-friendly Interface**: Built with Streamlit, providing an easy-to-use web interface for input and prediction.
- **Text Preprocessing**: Utilizes NLTK for tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and other text preprocessing techniques.
- **Model & Vectorizer**: The model and vectorizer are pre-trained using scikit-learn, making the app ready for deployment and real-time usage.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Streamlit** for the web interface
- **NLTK** for natural language processing
- **Scikit-Learn** for machine learning model training
